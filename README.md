# break-a-pod-game-multiplatform
Repository for the multi platform version of the game

# Requirements
Not 100% sure what the requirements are.
I installed Android Studio and Android SDK and that seems to be enough. Not sure about iOS

The project includes PC, Android and iOS versions

Most of the code is written for the PC version and it can then be built for Android and iOS. 

The platform specific parts of the project are mostly for controls I think
